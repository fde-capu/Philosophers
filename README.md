### Philosophers
@ 42 São Paulo

philo_one:

• A number of philosophers is sitting at a round table doing one of three things:
eating, thinking or sleeping.
• While eating, they are not thinking or sleeping, while sleeping, they are not eating
or thinking and of course, while thinking, they are not eating or sleeping.
• The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
• There are some forks on the table.
• As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a
philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.
• The philosophers must never be starving.
• Every philosopher needs to eat.
• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
• Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die.
• Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping.
• When a philosopher is done sleeping, he will start thinking.
• The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.


Usage:

`philo_one number_of_philosophers time_to_diea time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`
(same for `philo_two` and `philo_three`)
